 <h2>John Conway's game of Life</h2>
                <p>
                  The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a
                  cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge
                  mathematician John Conway.

                  This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an
                  article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists
                  of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical
                  rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial
                  conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the
                  course of the game.

                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p>
                  For a space that is populated:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by
                  overpopulation.
                </p>
                <p>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</p>
                <p>For a space that is empty or unpopulated:</p>
                <p>Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated</p>
                <h4>The Controls</h4>
                <p>
                  Make a pattern by clicking on the cells. The 'Start' button
                  advances the game by several generations (each new generation
                  corresponding to one iteration of the rules).
